Not fun, right? Let's jump right in, and we'll see if you enjoy it!\r\n\r\n```\r\nprint(\"Welcome to Python 3!\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nWelcome, young cadets, to Python 3. A planet with a slightly toxic, but organic-supporting atmosphere.\r\n\r\n![](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100113135842/starwars/images/4/4e/PurplePlanet-FT.jpg)\r\n\r\nPlease keep your masks on at all times.\r\n![](http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v625/lostncybr/Avatar/8ac4e8fc.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Your complementary Pip-Boy 3000.\r\n![](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110809182235/fallout/images/c/c0/VaultBoyFO3.png)\r\n\r\n## Get your Nitrous.io account\r\n[Press here to register for a Nitrous.io account.](https://www.nitrous.io/join/9rglqEXeoyw?utm_source=nitrous.io&utm_medium=copypaste&utm_campaign=referral)\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/crD3Dks.png)\r\nAfter creating an account and logging into Nitrous.io, hit this button!\r\n\r\n[![Hack DragonStuff/Python-In-45-Minutes on Nitrous.IO](https://d3o0mnbgv6k92a.cloudfront.net/assets/hack-l-v1-4b6757c3247e3c50314390ece34cdb11.png)](https://www.nitrous.io/hack_button?source=embed&runtime=rails&repo=DragonStuff%2FPython-In-45-Minutes&file_to_open=README)\r\n\r\n navigate to the [_boxes_](https://www.nitrous.io/app#/boxes) page.\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/ONyTKJY.png)\r\nCreate yourself a new box with the following settings:\r\n- Select **Python/Django**.\r\n- Enter any name you want, or accept the (_rather cool_) autogenerated name.\r\n- Select **Oceania** as your Region.\r\n- Have as much (_or as little_) RAM/Storage as you want.\r\n- Enter this in \"Download a Github repo\" `https://github.com/DragonStuff/Python-In-45-Minutes`\r\n\r\nHit \"Create Box\", and this screen will appear before you are redirected to your new box.\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/JYsZvDx.png)\r\n\r\n### Some rules to follow when saving files.\r\n\r\n- **Always save the program with the extension .py.** Do not put another dot anywhere else in the file name.\r\n- Only use standard characters for file names: letters, numbers, dash (-) and underscore (_).\r\n- White space (\" \") should not be used at all (**use underscores** instead).\r\n- Do not use anything other than a letter (particularly no numbers!) at the beginning of a file name.\r\n- Do not use \"non-english\" characters (such as ä, ö, ü, å or ß) in your file names—or, even better, do not use them at all when programming.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@0xdragon is the author of this document which was used for teaching a 2014 class Python in only 45 minutes.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
